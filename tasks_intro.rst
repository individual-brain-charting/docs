Apart from the MRI data, IBC is also a great resource for cognitive experiments. We have ran over 80 different experiments - gathered from our fellow researchers in the community - that altogether probe a large variety of cognitive domains in the human brain. The following figure depicts how much of the human brain cortex we have covered with these experiments. 

The codes and stimuli for all these experiments are openly available on the `individual-brain-charting/public_protocols <https://github.com/individual-brain-charting/public_protocols>`__ repository. Most of the experiments were implemented with Python, MATLAB or Octave and are hence readily usable. However, some of the experiments were originally implemented with proprietary softwares, and that was what we also used and have provided on the repo. You would still need to have access to these softwares to run those experiments. 

Below, you can find the paradigm descriptions, conditions, contrasts as well as the sample `stimulation videos <https://www.youtube.com/@individualbraincharting6314/videos>`__ for each of these tasks. To help you look for relevant tasks, we have also tagged each of them with some of the broad :bdg-primary:`cognitive_domains` they intend to probe. These tags are based on the definitions from `Cognitive Atlas <https://www.cognitiveatlas.org/concepts>`__. 

So :code:`Ctrl+F` for your favorite cognitive domain and implement the task in your own lab.
