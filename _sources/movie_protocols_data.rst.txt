Movie protocols implementation
==============================

In this section, we provide details of the movie protocols used in the IBC project as some might be relevant
for the analysis of the data and reproduction of the protocols.

Lags in Raiders movie 
---------------------

It has been noted that there was a lag between the acquisition onset and the stimuli onset. In other words, 
the presentation of the movie didn't start immediately when the acquisition started, but with a delay that 
varied between runs and subjects.

When synchrony between the movie and acquisition times is required, this lag must be considered.
We provide here the exact lag for each run and each subject. Note that this table can also be 
download as a *csv* file `here <https://github.com/individual-brain-charting/docs/blob/main/movie_protocols_data/lags_raiders.csv>`__.

The *lag* represents the time between the acquisition onset and the stimuli onset, in milliseconds.
The *run* column includes the video file name corresponding to the movie section shown during each run, along with the respective run number.
Please note that the first three sections of the movie (movie clips displayed during the first three runs) were presented to the participants 
again at the end of the last session. As a result, the *run* column includes the video file name and the run number for the first three, 
along with the *test* legend.

Lags in GoodBadUgly movie
-------------------------

Similar to the Raiders movie, there was a lag between the acquisition onset and the stimuli onset along the runs of the GoodBadUgly movie.
This lag could vary across runs and subjects, and should be considered when synchrony between the movie and acquisition times is required.

We provide here the exact lag for each run and each subject. Note that this table can also be
download as a *csv* file `here <https://github.com/individual-brain-charting/docs/blob/main/movie_protocols_data/lags_goodbadugly.csv>`__.

The *lag* represents the time between the acquisition onset and the stimuli onset, in milliseconds.
The *run* column includes the video file name corresponding to the movie section shown during each run, along with the respective run number.
Please note that the first three sections of the movie (movie clips displayed during the first three runs) were presented to the participants 
again at the end of the last session. As a result, the *run* column includes the video file name and the run number for the first three, 
along with the *test* legend.

Lags in MonkeyKingdom movie
----------------------------

We report here the exact lags for each run across subjects for the Monkey Kingdom movie. 
The *lag* represents the time between the acquisition onset and the stimuli onset, and could vary across runs and subjects.

This table can be downloaded `here <https://github.com/individual-brain-charting/docs/blob/main/movie_protocols_data/lags_monkeykingdom.csv>`__.

The *lags* are reported in milliseconds.
