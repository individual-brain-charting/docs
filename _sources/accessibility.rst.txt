Data papers
-----------

All data-descriptor, peer-reviewed articles of the
IBC-dataset—*aka*—data papers, are open access. They contain information about: *(1)* the overall scope of the IBC project; *(2)* demographic data of the cohort; *(3)* description of the experimental procedures undertaken; *(4)* materials and methods used; and *(5)* technical validation of the dataset.

- The first data paper (`Pinho et al., 2018 <https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2018.105>`__) is available under the following DOI: `10.1038/sdata.2018.105 <https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2018.105>`__. In this article, we introduce the IBC project and describe the ARCHI and HCP batteries plus the RSVP Language task.

- The second data paper (`Pinho et al., 2020 <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00670-4>`__) is available under the following DOI: `10.1038/s41597-020-00670-4 <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00670-4>`__. In this article, we present an extension of the IBC dataset, which comprehends the MTT, Preference and TOM batteries as well as the VSTM, Enumeration, Self and *Bang* tasks.
