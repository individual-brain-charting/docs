Behavioral Data 
===============

For most of the tasks we collect participants' responses, in order to asses their engagement and performance.
We calculate the accuracy of the subjects' responses and we present a brief description of what this accuracy represents.

MTTWE Behavioral Data
---------------------

If the Cue presented in the given trial hinted at time judgment, participants were to 
judge whether the previous Event occurred before the Reference, by pressing the button 
of the left hand, or after the Reference, by pressing the button  of the right hand. If 
the Cue concerned with space judgment, the participants were to judge, in the same way, 
whether the Event occurred west or east of the Reference. These scores were estimated 
considering the answers provided during the Event+Response conditions.

MTTNS Behavioral Data
---------------------

If the Cue presented in the given trial hinted at time judgment, participants were to 
judge whether the previous Event occurred before the Reference, by pressing the button 
of the left hand, or after the Reference, by pressing the button  of the right hand. If 
the Cue concerned with space judgment, the participants were to judge, in the same way, 
whether the Event occurred north or south of the Reference. These scores were estimated 
considering the answers provided during the Event+Response conditions. Chance level was
set at 50%.
*Note:* Low scores for sub-15 relate to loss of behavioral data during acquisition time 
in MTTWE and MTTNS tasks.

TheoryOfMind Behavioral Data
----------------------------

Participants were to judge whether a statement about the story previously displayed is 
true or false by pressing respectively with the index or middle finger. The chance 
level was 50%.

VSTM Behavioral Data
--------------------

Participants were to remember the orientation of the bars from the previous sample 
and answer with one of the two possible button presses depending on whether one of the 
bars in the current display had changed orientation by 90â—¦ or not, which was the case 
in half of the trials. For each level of numerosity, scores in every run are related to 
the trials referring to visual stimuli matching the specified numerosity. The chance
level was 50%.

Enumeration Behavioral Data
---------------------------

Participants had to remember the number of the bars that were shown right before and 
answer accordingly, by pressing the corresponding button. The number of bars presented 
in the visual stimuli ranged from 1 to 8. For each level of numerosity, scores in every 
run are related to the trials referring to visual stimuli matching the specified 
numerosity. The chance level was 12.5%.

Self Behavioral Data
--------------------

During the trials of the *encoding blocks*, participants had to press a specific button 
depending on whether they believed or not the adjective on display described someone 
(i.e. self or other, respectively for self-reference encoding or other-reference 
encoding conditions). During the trials of the *recognition block*, participants had 
to answer in the same way, depending on whether they believed or not the adjective had 
been presented before.
*No. of trials* refers to the number of trialsonly for the recognition phase in the 
specified run and, thus, not to the total number of trials in the run. Because run 3 
was longer than the remainder ones, the number of trials for the recognition phase was 
therefore greater. The chance level was 50%.

MathLanguage Behavioral Data
----------------------------

Subjects were presented with a series of facts (geometrical, arithmetical,
general knowledge, nonsense sentences, etc) and were asked to indicate whether the 
presented fact was true or false. Subjects were instructed to consider nonsense as false. 
Scores were calculated based on the number of correct responses. When there was no
answer for a given trial, it was considered a wrong answer, and where the subject 
answered more than once per trial, the first answer was considered. Since this is 
"true or false" task, the chance level was 50%.

SpatialNavigation Behavioral Data
---------------------------------

Subjects were positioned in an given intersection on a virtual city and were asked to 
point in the direction of a key building by rotating their point of view on a 360 
degrees panorama. Scores were narrowed down to whether the subject pointed to the 
correct cardinal direction, as if their error was within 45 absolute degrees of the 
correct direction, and the number of correct responses was counted. The chance level 
then was 25%. This was decided due to the the premise was just instructed to point to 
the location of the building, but there was no explicit precision requirement.

EmoMem Behavioral Data
----------------------

Subjects were asked to press a button when they though of a link or "story" between 
two images. The score is calculated as the amount of responses on a run, which if the 
subject was attentive, should be equal to the number of trials. The chance level is 50%.

EmoReco Behavioral Data
-----------------------

Participants were instructed to press a specific button when the face corresponded to a 
man, and a different one  when it did to a female. Their responses were collected and 
the score was calculated as the number of correct responses, with a chance level of 50%. 
Missed responses were considered incorrect.

StopNogo Behavioral Data
------------------------

Participants were presented with color-coded arrows. If the arrow was green, they were 
instructed to press a button, and if it was red, they were instructed to not respond.
The trick came when the arrow started out green but turned red after a few milliseconds, 
and the subject had to withhold their response. The score was calculated as the number 
of trials in which they succeeded in withholding their response.

Catell Behavioral Data
----------------------

Subjects were presented with four images in a row, and were asked to identify the 
oddball by pressing the corresponding button. The score was calculated as the number of 
correct responses, with a chance level of 25%.

FingerTapping Behavioral Data
--------------------------------------

Subjects were asked to press a button with their right hand, either a specific finger 
or the one they chose  themselves within a set of selected fingers. The score was 
calculated as the number of correct responses, meaning the number of times the subject 
pressed the correct button on specified trials plus the times they pressed a button 
within the selected fingers on chosen trials. The chance level was 25%.

VSTMC Behavioral Data
------------------------------

Participants had to indicate the direction of motion of a set of dots by pointing a 
probe in the corresponding direction. Subjects could make 360 degrees rotations of the 
probe, and a response would be considered correct of the final angle would be within 45 
absolute degrees of the correct direction. The score was calculated as the number of 
correct responses.

RewProc Behavioral Data
-----------------------

Participants were tasked with choosing between two presented figures. Depending on 
their choice, they wold have higher or lower probability of increasing their virtual 
reward. The score was determined by the number of responses in a run, reflecting their
level of attentiveness. The chance level is set at 50\%

NARPS Behavioral Data
---------------------

Subjects were instructed to either accept or reject a gamble, indicating high or low 
confidence by pressing the corresponding button. The score reflects the level of 
attention of the subject and was calculated as the number of responses made during a 
run, excluding any missed responses. The chance level is set at 50%.

FaceBody Behavioral Data
------------------------

Subjects were instructed to press a button every time an image repeated as a mirrored 
image (a flipped 1-back task). The score was calculated based on the number of correct 
responses. Missed responses were counted as incorrect.

Scene Behavioral Data
---------------------

Subjects had to judge whether Escher-like scenes were possible or impossible. 
Additionally, there were "dot" trials, where they had to indicate whether the dot 
appeared on the right or left side of the screen. The score was determined by the 
number of scenes they judged correctly, plus the number of dots correctly located. 
Missing responses were counted as incorrect, with a chance level of 50%.

ItemRecognition Behavioral Data
---------------------------------------

Participants were tasked to memorize a target and then indicate whether a probe was the 
same as the target. The score was calculated as the number of correct decisions. 
Missed responses were marked as incorrect, and the chance level was 50%.

VisualSearch Behavioral Data
----------------------------

In the VisualSearch task there were two trials. On the *visual search* trials, 
participants had to indicate whether the target was present or absent in an array of 
items. On the *working memory* trials, they had to indicate whether a probe was present 
in a previously shown set of items. The score was calculated as the sum of correct 
responses in both types of trials. Missing responses were marked as incorrect, and the 
chance level was 50%.
