API Installation
----------------

To facilitate data fetching with minimal coding, we've integrated powerful tools into
this `API <https://github.com/individual-brain-charting/api>`__.

To install the package containing the API, execute the following command:

.. raw:: html

.. code-block:: python
    :name: quick_install

    pip install git+https://github.com/individual-brain-charting/api.git#egg=ibc_api

This api is under active development, so make sure to update it regularly:

.. code-block:: python
    :name: quick_update

    pip install -U git+https://github.com/individual-brain-charting/api.git#egg=ibc_api
