# Individual Brain Charting

The Individual Brain Charting (IBC) project has collected a high-resolution multi-task-fMRI dataset to provide an objective basis for a comprehensive atlas of brain responses. The data refer to a cohort of participants performing many different tasks. Acquiring a large amount of tasks on the same subjects yields a precise mapping of the underlying functions, free from both inter-subject and inter-site variability. Additionally, the dataset comes with high-resolution anatomical and diffusion images, to achieve a fine anatomical characterization of these brains.
