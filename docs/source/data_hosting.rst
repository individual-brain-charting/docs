Data hosting
============

EBRAINS
-------

The primary hosting facility for the IBC project is `EBRAINS <https://www.ebrains.eu/>`__.
The dataset is published in the EBRAINS `Knowledge Graph <https://search.kg.ebrains.eu/?category=Dataset>`__, a platform for sharing and accessing neuroscience data.
Please note that to access the data, you must create an account. You can register for an account by clicking `here <https://www.ebrains.eu/page/sign-up>`__.

The IBC dataset is available in the Knowledge Graph as a collection of instances, each of which represents a different aspect of the dataset:

Raw fMRI data
-------------

The most recent version of the raw fMRI data can be accessed by following this `link <https://search.kg.ebrains.eu/instances/8ddf749f-fb1d-4d16-acc3-fbde91b90e24>`__.
This collection contains high resolution raw fMRI data, along with Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) and various structural MRI data (T1-weighted, T2-weighted and FLAIR imaging).
Additionally, task-specific details are provided for each task within the dataset.

Preprocessed fMRI data
----------------------

The preprocessed fMRI data repository can be accessed by this `link <https://search.kg.ebrains.eu/instances/3ca4f5a1-647b-4829-8107-588a699763c1>`__.
This collection also contains task-specific information and subject-specific confounds and event-related log files.

Statistical contrast maps
-------------------------

Derived statistical contrast maps have been released `here <https://search.kg.ebrains.eu/instances/ad04f919-7dcc-48d9-864a-d7b62af3d49d>`__.
These maps are provided in both volume and surface space formats, with contrast labels corresponding to those outlined in the documentation.
