Data hosting
============

EBRAINS
-------

The primary hosting facility for the IBC project is `EBRAINS <https://www.ebrains.eu/>`__.
The dataset is published in the EBRAINS `Knowledge Graph <https://search.kg.ebrains.eu/?category=Dataset>`__, a platform for sharing and accessing neuroscience data.
Please note that to access the data, you must create an account. You can register for an account by clicking `here <https://www.ebrains.eu/page/sign-up>`__.

The IBC dataset is available in the Knowledge Graph as a collection of instances, each of which represents a different aspect of the dataset:

Raw fMRI data
-------------

The most recent version of the raw fMRI data can be accessed by following this `link <https://search.kg.ebrains.eu/instances/8ddf749f-fb1d-4d16-acc3-fbde91b90e24>`__.
This collection contains high resolution raw fMRI data, along with Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) and various structural MRI data (T1-weighted, T2-weighted and FLAIR imaging).
Additionally, task-specific details are provided for each task within the dataset.

Preprocessed fMRI data
----------------------

The preprocessed fMRI data repository can be accessed on this `link <https://search.kg.ebrains.eu/instances/44214176-0e8c-48de-8cff-4b6f9593415d>`__.
This collection also contains task-specific information and subject-specific confounds and event-related log files.

Along with this, we provide a version of the preprocessed data that have been resampled at 3-millimeter isotropic resolution.
This version can be accessed by following this `link <https://search.kg.ebrains.eu/instances/ed615ee5-fdaa-4f1d-8fcd-8c55d05a4e2d>`__.

Statistical contrast maps
-------------------------

Derived statistical contrast maps have been released `here <https://search.kg.ebrains.eu/instances/131add71-e838-4dab-b953-7b7a69ac5d8f>`__.
These maps are provided in both volume and surface space formats, with contrast labels corresponding to those outlined in the documentation.
